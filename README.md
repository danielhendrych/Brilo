My project is run with three simple files: index.html, styles.css and index.js. I created the whole structure in the html file:
1. Navbar
2. Current time
3. Section with the personal info and photography
4. The Discography section
5. Footer

CSS: I used the BEM naming system since it is useful for constructing scalable and maintainable interfaces. I used comments to separate each section of the page.

JS: I created a simple function of getting the current time. I think that a little javascript function can always improve any project. :)

I hope you will like my project.

Best regards

Daniel Hendrych
